# OperatingPlatforms
Repository for my CS-230 Operating Platforms class at SNHU

•	Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client wanted to build a cross-platform version of their mobile app “Draw It or Lose It,” which is currently only available for Android.

•	What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

The document required knowledge of different operating systems, servers, and other key components such as memory, and system storage. I believe I did well in creating the UML for the application as well as recommending an operating platform to host their web-based game.

•	What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

I found the UML diagrams that we created especially helpful when developing the code for the program. Knowing how to properly model and read the UML diagram, and taking time to make sure the document models the proper structure of the code, creates a smooth transition into implementing the code. In fact, I would compare creating a UML diagram and other software documents before developing code to making blueprints for a building before getting started on the construction; it takes out a great deal of the guesswork.

•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

Considering, I just finished the document there isn’t much that I would consider adding or changing; however, as I begin to develop more in learning programming concepts and design principles, I know that my efficiency with programming and my overall thought process will continue to grow as well. I’m eager to see how I will go about trying to implement this same assignment a year or two down the road.

•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

By considering how the users experience playing the game, such as fast and smooth loading for the game and the ability to load and save data, you can properly decide what tools and code one would need to implement. By considering the client’s and user’s needs you are ensuring you are making a product that is desired by both. If you make a product that meets the client’s specifications, but is not secure and leads to compromised user accounts, then you have ultimately delivered a failed product.

•	How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

When designing the software, I had the UML diagram beside me the entire time. If there wasn’t something I was sure of, I reviewed the UML diagram and the client’s request. If there was something I didn’t know how to do referencing the diagram, then I would look it up and figure it out, so that I could properly incorporate the code. After experiencing code development using this method, I believe I will continue to follow this structure from now on. I think having a plan before the development and sticking with that plan, can serve as a tremendous boon not only for a developer but for their team members that will be working on the application at different times and intervals of the development and refactoring process.
